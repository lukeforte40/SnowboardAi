**Snowboard Recommendation Model**
This webapp is designed to filter through snowboards by conversing with the user and determining what kind of board would be best suited for them. Like Curated but with an ai model instead.

**Goals**
* Learn about ai models used for recommendation engines
* Make a good project to host on my resume and portfolio
* Learn more about and foster skills in AI/ML 

**Objectives**
* Document my process
* Build an ai recommendation model to recommend snowboards to users. (Act similar to snowboard salesman with prompts questions for the user to answer)
* Web scrape various snowboards from different brands and link to the distributors.
* Make a simple and easy to use UI.

**Requirements**
* Simple easy UI
* Ai snowboard recommender
* Web scrape snowboards from various manufacturers
* As low cost as possible

**Recommendation engine Specs**
Based on light research I Will try to create a hybrid based filtering model that uses both collaborative and content-based data.
